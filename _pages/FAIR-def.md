The FAIR data principles were put forth by a diverse set of stakeholders representing academia, industry, funding agencies, and scholarly publishers in 2016 to provide guidelines for the improvement of Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reusability of scholarly data. [(M. D. Wilkinson et al. Scientific Data
(2016))](http://www.nature.com/articles/sdata201618)

This wiki aims to highlight some of the efforts and tools that support the FAIR principles and are aimed to be used by the neuroscience community and some general resources as well.
