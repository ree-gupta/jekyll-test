              The International Neuroinformatics CoordinatingFacility (INCF)
              is an independent organization with a mission to develop, evaluate,
              and endorse standards and best practices that embrace the principles
              of Open, FAIR, and Citable neuroscience. They have adopted a rigorous
              and formal procedure for evaluating and endorsing community standards
              and best practices in support of the FAIR principles.
